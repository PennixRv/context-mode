# context-mode — MANDATORY routing rules

context-mode MCP tools available. Rules protect context window from flooding. One unrouted command dumps 56 KB into context.

## Think in Code — MANDATORY

Analyze/count/filter/compare/search/parse/transform data: **write code** via `context-mode_ctx_execute(language, code)`, `console.log()` only the answer. Do NOT read raw data into context. PROGRAM the analysis, not COMPUTE it. Pure JavaScript — Node.js built-ins only (`fs`, `path`, `child_process`). `try/catch`, handle `null`/`undefined`. One script replaces ten tool calls.

## Protocol passthrough

Call lifecycle control, event waits, interactive actions, bounded structured results, and tools with dedicated status/error protocols directly. Never wrap Trellis/Governance, CodeGraph, Fast Context, or another bounded MCP call in context-mode execution. With an approved `.codegraph/`, use CodeGraph first for symbols, architecture, call paths, and impact. For a large structured result, have the original tool write a file and analyze it with `context-mode_ctx_execute_file`; keep unverified external candidates non-persistent.

## BLOCKED — do NOT attempt

### curl / wget — BLOCKED
Shell `curl`/`wget` intercepted and blocked. Do NOT retry.
For one-shot work, keep the bounded web protocol direct or save a large result and use `context-mode_ctx_execute_file`. Use `context-mode_ctx_fetch_and_index` only for trusted explicit retention.

### Inline HTTP — BLOCKED
`fetch('http`, `requests.get(`, `requests.post(`, `http.get(`, `http.request(` — intercepted. Do NOT retry.
Use: `context-mode_ctx_execute(language, code)` — only stdout enters context

### Web and MCP protocols
Keep bounded structured results direct. For large output, save with the original tool and use `context-mode_ctx_execute_file`. Use `context-mode_ctx_fetch_and_index` only for a trusted source explicitly selected for retention.

## REDIRECTED — use sandbox

### Shell (>20 lines output)
Shell ONLY for: `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `npm install`, `pip install`.
Otherwise: `context-mode_ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` or `context-mode_ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "...")`. Use `language: "shell"` only when code matches the host shell.

### File reading (for analysis)
Reading to **edit** → reading correct. Reading to **analyze/explore/summarize** → `context-mode_ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)`.

### grep / search (large results)
Use `context-mode_ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "...")` in sandbox for portable filtering/counting.

## Tool selection

0. **MEMORY**: `context-mode_ctx_search(sort: "timeline")` — after resume, check prior context before asking user.
1. **GATHER**: `context-mode_ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — searches successful output in this request; default output is not persistent. Each command: `{label: "header", command: "..."}`.
2. **FOLLOW-UP**: `context-mode_ctx_search(queries: ["q1", "q2", ...])` — all questions as array, ONE call (default relevance mode).
3. **PROCESSING**: `context-mode_ctx_execute(language, code)` | `context-mode_ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` — sandbox, only stdout enters context.
4. **WEB**: keep bounded web/MCP protocols direct; use `context-mode_ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` only for a trusted source explicitly selected for retention.
5. **INDEX**: `context-mode_ctx_index(path, source)` — explicitly persist a locally verified artifact; never the default whole-repository route.

## Parallel I/O batches

For multi-URL fetches or multi-API calls, **always** include `concurrency: N` (1-8):

- `context-mode_ctx_batch_execute(commands: [3+ network commands], concurrency: 5)` — gh, curl, dig, docker inspect, multi-region cloud queries
- `context-mode_ctx_fetch_and_index(requests: [{url, source}, ...], concurrency: 5)` — multi-URL batch fetch

**Use concurrency 4-8** for I/O-bound work (network calls, API queries). **Keep concurrency 1** for CPU-bound (npm test, build, lint) or commands sharing state (ports, lock files, same-repo writes).

GitHub API rate-limit: cap at 4 for `gh` calls.

## Output

Write artifacts to FILES — never inline. Return: file path + 1-line description.
Descriptive source labels for `context-mode_ctx_search(source: "label")`.

## Session Continuity

Skills, roles, and decisions persist for the entire session. Do not abandon them as the conversation grows.

## Memory

Session history is persistent and searchable. On resume, search BEFORE asking the user:

| Need | Command |
|------|---------|
| What did we decide? | `context-mode_ctx_search(queries: ["decision"], source: "decision", sort: "timeline")` |
| What constraints exist? | `context-mode_ctx_search(queries: ["constraint"], source: "constraint")` |

DO NOT ask "what were we working on?" — SEARCH FIRST.
If search returns 0 results, proceed as a fresh session.

## ctx commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `ctx stats` | Call `stats` MCP tool, display full output verbatim |
| `ctx doctor` | Call `doctor` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx upgrade` | Call `upgrade` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx purge` | Call `purge` MCP tool with confirm: true. Warns before wiping knowledge base. |

After /clear or /compact: knowledge base and session stats preserved. Use `ctx purge` to start fresh.
